# The_Red_Users_Internship

TASK 1:
1. Learn Network Security Concepts:
o Research and summarize different types of network threats, including viruses, worms,
trojans, and phishing attacks.
o Understand basic security concepts like firewalls, encryption, and secure network
configurations.

2. Implement Basic Security Measures:
o Set up a simple network environment, such as your home network or a virtual lab with a
router and one or two connected devices.

The Red Users

o Enable and configure a basic firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) to block
unauthorized access.
o Set up basic security configurations, such as changing default passwords and enabling
network encryption (WPA2 or WPA3).

3. Monitor Network Traffic:
o Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
o Identify different types of traffic, such as HTTP, DNS, and others, and understand what they
mean.
o Learn how to spot unusual or suspicious traffic that might indicate a security threat.

Task 2: Introduction to Web Application Security
Objective:
Learn about common web application vulnerabilities by analyzing a simple web application. This task will
help you understand how attackers can exploit weaknesses in web applications.
Skills:
Basic Web Security, Vulnerability Identification
Tools:
OWASP ZAP, WebGoat (or another vulnerable web application)
Guidelines:
1. Setup:
o Install and set up WebGoat or another intentionally vulnerable web application on your local
machine.
o Ensure you understand how the application works and how to access it.
2. Perform Basic Vulnerability Analysis:
o Use OWASP ZAP to scan the web application for vulnerabilities.
o Focus on identifying at least one instance each of SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),
and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

3. Explore Vulnerabilities:
o Understand how each vulnerability works by reading the descriptions provided by OWASP
ZAP.
o Attempt to manually exploit these vulnerabilities using basic techniques (e.g., inserting SQL
code in a login form).
